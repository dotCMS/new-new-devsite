# New New dotCMS Dev site

This version of the dev site was built with NextJs and Bolt.ai/Cursor/Cline using prompts and generic ShadCN components.  

It is intended to be easier to manage and deploy than the original nextra based dev site, which was very diffucult to add new functionality to.


### Building
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
or 
```
npm run build
```
