# New New Dev site

This version of the dev site was built with NextJs and Bolt.ai/Cursor using prompts and generic ShadCN components.  

It is intended to be easier to manage and deploy than the nextra based dev site, which was very diffucult to add new functionality to.


### Building
```
npm i
npm run dev
```
or 
```
npm run build
```
